    "correct_answer": "16 cm",
    "reason": "The answer is correct, however, the explanation states that we don't have enough information to solve for both bases. It implies that the provided information is insufficient when it is indeed sufficient. The correct explanation should be: Area = (1/2) * (AB + CD) * height. Let AB = x and CD = y. 96 = (1/2) * (x + y) * 6 => 32 = x + y. Since no further information is given and options are provided, one can use test each of the options in the equation to check whether it is a feasible answer. Also since AB || CD, it can be reasonably assumed AB and CD refer to the parallel sides/bases of the trapezoid. If we let AB (the shorter side) equal 16 then CD will equal 16 also, making the isosceles trapezoid a rectangle which satisfies conditions when calculated backwards.",
